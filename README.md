Our Project
-----------
Our project consists of several directories:

- classification: a directory with an iPython notebook that contains our process for classifying transactions into categories
- prototype: a prototype for the force directed graph we made earlier (can be ignored)
- scraping: a set of iPython notebooks that scrapes the data from Venmo's public API
- site: our website directory that holds the final website
- stacking: code we previously used to stack data for the stacked area chart before we started doing it in D3 (can be ignored)
- All other files are intuitive and/or are insignificant and can be ignored

We wrote the following JS and CSS files:

- main2.css
- style.css
- BeeSwarm.js
- brushingTimeline.js
- data-wrapper.js
- hangoutsTimeline.js
- legend.js
- local-network.js
- main.js
- piechart.js
- scrolling.js
- stackedAreaChart.js
- wordcloud.js
- index.html (came with template but was heavily modified by us)

And modified small portions of the other files that came with the HTML template.

Libraries
---------
We used the following libraries in our site implementation:

- Cloud.js
- Materialize.js
- jLouvain.js
- HTML Template "Proton" by Uldeck

We used the following libraries in our data scraping/cleaning:
